This assignment was completed by group #1.
The folder I'm in is the eclipse project for the assignment, so the simplest way to build the project is to import it as an eclipse project.

The main entry point for the program is in ./src/ec2017/ga/tsp/TSPProblem.java
When run, the project will run benchmarking and extensive testing using a variety of algorithms using the data found in ./TSP_data.
If you'd like to try the program without waiting days, remove the larger data sets from ./TSP_data.
Output will be generated in ./output.
